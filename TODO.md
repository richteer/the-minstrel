 - [x] improve voice_ready checking
 - [ ] some kind of storage system (started)
 - [x] playlist fetching
 - [x] autoplay
 - [x] playlist merging
 - [x] merged playlist balancing
 - [x] playlist merge based on current active voice users
 - [x] use a hashmap-backed priority queue for autoplay usertime
 - [x] cache user scores to prevent cheating by re-entering
 - [ ] consider re-entering user's "catch-up" score (maybe don't re-enter at lowest-1, consider average?)
 - [ ] don't autoplay from the same person twice in a row
 - [x] ability to rebalance / reset playlist merge
 - [ ] balance randomized songs from playlist based on # of plays (avoid repeats)
 - [ ] help text (started)
 - [ ] display current song as a status/presence
 - [x] prefetch a number of autoplay songs so that a "queue" can be displayed for what's up next
 - [x] fix stale voice state when killing bot without exiting
 - [x] sticky nowplaying message
 - [ ] reaction-based music controls
 - [ ] refetch information that is cached that shouldn't be
 - [ ] add configuration options loaded from file
 - [ ] add command to modify config at runtime
 - [ ] implement some kind of permissions control
 - [ ] time remaining in queue, how much time has played, etc
 - [ ] command to dump songs from autoplay into actual queue (and stop autoplay maybe?)
 - [ ] general statistics logging, average song length, etc
 - [ ] consider having the queue balance with autoplay fairness, don't always take queue prio
 - [x] implement some kind of logging system
 - [x] record a cache of last played songs
 - [ ] reaction-based "starring" or "thumbs-up" of songs
 - [ ] look into weird playback speed problems
 - [ ] nowplaying should state where it sourced the song (autoplay, queue, etc)
 - [ ] allow users to store multiple playlists
 - [ ] cache playlists and metadata, fetch them in a background thread on launch
 - [ ] show removed/privated songs from cache?
 - [ ] investigate what happens on a playback error mid queue/autoplay (privated vid between add and play)
 - [ ] write a dang README


tasks needed for 24/7 operation:
 - [ ] refetch playlist info periodically -> may depend on randomization changes, as it might squash current random
 - [ ] clean up leave/stop etc behavior
   - [ ] clear all autoplay scores when exiting voice
   - [x] disable auto-sticky
   - [ ] auto-leave if voice channel is empty
 - [ ] clean up logging, make logging songs nicer. maybe impl Debug for Song

commands:
 - `!skip` - end the current playing song
 - `!play` - append a song to the queue
 - `!playnext` - prepend a song to the queue
 - `!queue`, `!q` - display the current song queue
 - `!clearqueue` - clear the current song queue
 - `!autoplay`, `!ap` - toggle autoplay
